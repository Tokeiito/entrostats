# entrostats
This is a hunting stats tracker for Entropia Universe
Not sure who wrote the original tool but I rewrote the code quite a bit to be able to capture hunting stats real time, including but not limited to:
* multiple weapon support (based on using hotkeys to switch weapons)
* critical hit increase calculation
* critical dmg increase calculation (MACrit for formula used by MA)
* enhancer decay calculation including MU

open source
based on reading the chat.log so main chat logging must be enabled and pointed to the correct file in settings
all stats stored in ini files same folder as base
